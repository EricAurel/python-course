# Introduction to Introspection

> Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.

## Classic introspection

* [`help`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#help) takes an object and prints the documentation for that object.
* [`dir`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#dir) takes an object and returns a list of all attribute names. With those you can explore the object further.
* [`type`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#type) takes an object and returns a string representation of its type.
* [`isinstance`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#isinstance) tells you if the object is an instance of a given type
* the [inspect module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html) contains a lot of useful functions for even more advanced introspection of live objects
* the [sys module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#module-sys) contains information about the Python interpreter itself and the system the interpreter is running on. [`sys.argv`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.argv) is a list of command line arguments passed to the running script.
* the [sysconfig](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig) module provides access to Python's configuration information like the list of installation paths and the configuration variables relevant for the current platform.
* [`id`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#id) returns an int that is the unique id for that object in memory

Here is a good [old-school tutorial](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-pyint/) to introspection if you want to explore that a bit more.

## Tools for exploration

### PythonTutor: Visualize code execution

[PythonTutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html) is a great tool to understand what exactly going on, when executing simple Python code. It started as a research tool and is growing even new languages now.

### Ipython: Python interpreter on Steroids

If you want to try these things in a [REPL](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html#interactive-mode) (Read Eval Print Loop - a.k.a. Interactive mode) I would strongly recommend [Ipython](https://ipython.org/). It is much more powerful than the default REPL. It offers tab completion, syntax highlighting, shell functionality, prettier Tracebacks and a better help system. 

As an example for the nicer help system: instead of typing `help(sys)` you can type `sys?` to see the documentation and `sys??` to see the source code of the object you are interested in.

[Try Ipython online](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/).

### Jupyter: Interactive Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks - formerly known as Ipython notebooks - are a way to write code snippets with their output interwoven with content in interactive sessions in the browser. The results can be saved and rendered in many different output formats. Github renders these Notebooks by default.
 
The following examples demonstrate some more introspection activities with the help of Jupyter notebooks: 
 
* [Basic Introspection](introspection-basics.ipynb) 
* [Accessing system information](introspection-system.ipynb) 
* [A simple introspection function](introspection-function.ipynb).

## The PyCharm way of introspection

With the classic ways of introspection out of the way we can now look at using PyCharm for introspection and code exploration. The capabilities for code exploration and introspection are built on top of the languages capabilities for introspection offering a convenient interface to them.

### Reading documentation and source code

PyCharm offers a lot of actions to provide information about elements of your project. The most useful here are:

* [Quick Documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/5.0/viewing-inline-documentation.html)
* [Quick Definition](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/5.0/viewing-definition.html)
* [Go to Declaration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/5.0/navigating-to-declaration-or-type-declaration-of-a-symbol.html)

Invoking any of those actions with the cursor over a piece of code will provide more insight about that object.

You can query this information directly from the search popups to inspect the objects. As an example: If you want to know what you project contains to do with files you just type "file" in the "Search Everywhere" popup and get offered the file builtin, you can scroll down to that entry and invoke the Quick Documentation action and you see the documentation including a link to the external documentation on the web.

## Exploring the Structure

### Structure Tool Window

The [Structure Tool Window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/structure-tool-window-file-structure-popup.html) makes all classes and functions explorable from a bird's eye perspective.

### Goto Declaration and back

You can navigate the code by activating the "Goto Declaration" Action or by holding down `Ctrl` and clicking with the mouse on the object to go to the source code of the referenced object. The "Navigate Back" action (`Alt+left`) brings you back to the old position just like the history function in a web browser. This way of navigating through the code lets you see the code as a collection of connected objects instead of as just text.

### Auto Completion

This (especially in combination with "Quick Documentation" and "Quick Definition" directly from the completion popup) is actually also a very effective way to explore the code. Pycharm has basic and SmartType completion. I don't quite get the smart in smartType though ... it just offers you lots of types which are currently not imported. Auto Completion is [quite versatile](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/5.0/auto-completing-code.html?origin=old_help).

You can even use completion and query features in this markdown document (if you read the source of this file in PyCharm):

```python
import inspect

inspect.getcallargs(inspect.getargs)
```
