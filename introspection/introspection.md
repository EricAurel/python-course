# Introduction to Python Introspection

> Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.

Most of the introspection introductions deal with the inbuilt capabilities of Python and how to use them in a REPL. I will instead concentrate here on a mix of using PyCharms capabilities and little scripts using the introspective capabilities of Python. I might stretch the classic definition of introspection a bit here, as I am understanding it as well as exploring your project, the standard library and third party libraries.

## Search everywhere

The "Search Everywhere" action or `Shift, Shift` provides a comprehensive introspection into your whole project 

Here is a good [old-school tutorial](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-pyint/) to introspection if you want to explore that a bit more.

The [inspect module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html) contains a lot of useful functions for more advanced programmatic introspection
