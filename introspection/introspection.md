# Introduction to Introspection

> Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.

## Classic introspection

* `id` returns an int that is the unique id for that object in memory
* `dir` takes an object and returns a list of all attribute names. With those you can explore the object further.
* `help` takes an object and prints the documentation for that object.
* `type` takes an object and returns a string representation of its type.
* `isinstance` tells you if the object is an instance of a given type
* the [inspect module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html) contains a lot of useful functions for even more advanced introspection of live objects
* the [sys module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#module-sys) contains information about the Python interpreter itself and the system the interpreter is running on. `sys.argv` is a list of command line arguments passed to the running script.
* the [sysconfig](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig) provides access to Python's configuration information like the list of installation paths and the configuration variables relevant for the current platform.

Here is a good [old-school tutorial](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-pyint/) to introspection if you want to explore that a bit more.

### Better interactive exploration

If you want to try these things in a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop - a.k.a. Interactive Interpreter) I would strongly recommend [Ipython](https://ipython.org/). It is much more powerful than the default REPL with tab completion, syntax highlighting shell functionality and a powerful help system. Jupyter notebooks - formerly known as Ipython notebooks - are a way to save interactive sessions and their output in a way that Github knows to render - see this example [introspection](introspection.ipynb)

### Demos

* [basic object introspection](introspection.py)
* [some more interesting introspections](more-introspection.py)

## The PyCharm way of introspection

With the classic ways of introspection out of the we can now look at here using PyCharms for introspection and code exploration. The capabilities for code exploration and introspection are built on top of the languages capabilities for introspection offering a convenient interface to them.

## Reading documentation and source code

PyCharm offers a lot of actions to provide information about elements of your project. The most useful here are:

* Quick Documentation
* Quick Definition
* Go to Declaration

Invoking any of those actions with the cursor over a piece of code will provide more insight about that object.

You can query this information directly from the search popups to inspect the objects. As an example: If you want to know what you project contains to do with files you just type "file" in the "Search Everywhere" popup and get offered the file builtin, you can scroll down to that entry and invoke the Quick Documentation action and you see the documentation including a link to the external documentation on the web.

## Exploring the Structure

### Structure Tool Window

The [Structure Tool Window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/structure-tool-window-file-structure-popup.html) makes all classes and functions explorable from a bird's eye perspective.

### Goto Declaration and back

You can navigate the code by activating the "Goto Declaration" Action or by holding down `Ctrl` and clicking with the mouse on the object to go to the source code of the referenced object. The "Navigate Back" action (`Alt+left`) brings you back to the old position just like the history function in a web browser. This way of navigating through the code lets you see the code as a collection of connected objects instead of as just text.

### Auto Completion

This (especially in combination with "Quick Documentation" and "Quick Definition" directly from the completion popup) is actually also a very effective way to explore the code. Pycharm has basic and SmartType completion. I don't quite get the smart in smartType though ... it just offers you lots of types which are currently not imported. Auto Completion is [quite versatile](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/5.0/auto-completing-code.html?origin=old_help).

You can even use completion and query features in this markdown document (if you read the source of this file in PyCharm):

```python
import inspect

inspect.getcallargs(inspect.getargs)
```
